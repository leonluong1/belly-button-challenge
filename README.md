# Belly Button Biodiversity Data Visualization
Module 14 Belly Button Challenge -- Berkeley Data Analytics Boot Camp

This project is about examining the biodiversity of microbial species within individuals. We have HTML documents and JavaScript files that contain the code to create different charts that show the diversity in each sample. We took data from a website that contained data in json format.

## Project Description
This project is meant to test my JavaScript, D3, HTML and Plotly knowledge. I extracted json data from a [website](https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json) using D3 and manipulated the HTML page to include the new Plotly visualizations. 

The file types in this repository are JavaScript, JSON and HTML files.
